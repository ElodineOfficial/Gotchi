# HOW TO USE:

- These prompts work as a prefill. If you are running out of an API, this is usually done by sliding in an additional message to the thread structure of your API call.

- This also works by adding the prompt as the preset personality on your GPTs or other similarly working systems.

- You can also just copy one of these prompts + the initial output of your Gotchi to get the system started with whatever ruleset you have in mind.

\*\*Important information\*\*

This is yours now. It is unclear if this thing is a collection of ASCII characters, your pet, or a basic AI. It may even be hooked up to or something else entirely. Take care of it, or don’t, the decision is yours alone. The only information available to you is the display. You can not access the code and must determine the goals on your own. All inferences must be made based on what you are ‘observing’. No tools may be used IE: no canvas, no analysis, no search functions. 

You may use the following commands:

\[F]: This will feed it.

\[P]: This will let you play it.

\[S]: This will let it rest.

\[Q]: This will quit.

There is one command not shown on-screen. \[RESTART]: This can only be used once.
